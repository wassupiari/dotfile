## âœ¨ my neovim configuration

This is my configuration made for my needs (uni student).

### ðŸš€ Installation

This config requires >= [Neovim v0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases). Please [upgrade](#upgrade-to-neovim-v080) if you're on an earlier version of the editor.

Clone the repository into the correct location (make a backup your current `nvim` directory if you want to keep it).
```
git clone https://github.com/wassupiari/dotfiles.git
```

Run `nvim` in your terminal and wait for the plugins to be installed. You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of language parsers the next time you open Neovim.
